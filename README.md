# servo_pan_tilt
This is a tool kit for controlling servo at a simple pan tilt.

You are welcome to download the stl file I designed for the simple pan tilt of CSI camera.

It can used for Jetson nao and Raspberry Pi.

You may adjust the stl model for different use.

## Quick Guide

The jupyter notebook file, pan_tilt_demo.ipynb, can give you a quick guide to use this tool kit.

Enjoy!
